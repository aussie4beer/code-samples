        Connect to a Nutanix Prism Central instance, provide a Nutanix Calm blueprint UUID then launch the blueprint.
        
        The intention is to use this approach for the launch of Nutanix Calm blueprints as part of external script workflows.
        
        Requires only the blueprint UUID; all other requirements are extracted from the blueprint by making other API requests.

        Usage

        Virtual Environment
        ===================
        
        All the steps below assume you have a terminal session running with the current directory set to the location of the script.
        
        - It is strongly recommended to run development scripts like this within a virtual environment.  For example, if using Python 3.7 on Linux:
        
          .. code-block:: bash
        
             python3.7 -m venv venv
             . venv/bin/activate
        
        - Install dependencies:
        
          .. code-block:: bash
        
             pip3 install -e .
        
        - Edit basic parameters
        
           - **self.read_timeout** - Increase or decrease depending on the desired timeout delay (in seconds) for each request
        
        Script Command Line
        ===================
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           ./launch_calm_blueprint.py --help:
        
        Generates:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           usage: launch_calm_blueprint.py [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] pc_ip blueprint_uuid
        
           positional arguments:
             pc_ip                 Prism Central IP address
             blueprint_uuid        UUID of the blueprint to be launched
        
           optional arguments:
             -h, --help            show this help message and exit
             -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                                   Prism Central username
             -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                                   Prism Central password
             -d [enable/disable], --debug [enable/disable]
                                   Enable/disable debug mode e.g. show debug info at various stages through the script
